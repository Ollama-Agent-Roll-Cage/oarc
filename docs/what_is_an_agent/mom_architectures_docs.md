# Mixture of Models (MoM) Architectures

This document explores different architectural patterns for composing multiple AI models to work together in a synergistic manner. These patterns represent different governance models for how multiple models can collaborate, vote, debate, or support each other to produce better results than any single model could achieve alone.

## 1. Democracy Architecture

In the Democracy architecture, multiple models independently answer the same question, and the final answer is determined by a voting process.

%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'dark',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#2c3e50',
      'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#7f8c8d',
      'lineColor': '#ffffff',
      'secondaryColor': '#1abc9c',
      'tertiaryColor': '#2980b9'
    }
  }
}%%

    subgraph Democracy["DEMOCRACY"]
        D_Q[Question]:::questionNode
        D_M1[Model 1]:::modelNode
        D_M2[Model 2]:::modelNode
        D_M3[Model 3]:::modelNode
        D_M4[Model 4]:::modelNode
        D_A1[Answer 1]:::answerNode
        D_A2[Answer 2]:::answerNode
        D_A3[Answer 3]:::answerNode
        D_A4[Answer 4]:::answerNode
        D_V[Voting]:::voteNode
        D_F[Final Answer]:::answerNode
        
        D_Q --> D_M1 & D_M2 & D_M3 & D_M4
        D_M1 --> D_A1
        D_M2 --> D_A2
        D_M3 --> D_A3
        D_M4 --> D_A4
        D_A1 & D_A2 & D_A3 & D_A4 --> D_V
        D_V --> D_F
        
        D_note["Each model answers
Each votes
Answer with most votes wins"]
    end
    
    Democracy:::democracyNodes
```

### Key Characteristics

- **Equal Participation**: Each model receives the same question and generates its own answer.
- **Majority Rule**: The final answer is determined by which option receives the most votes.
- **No Hierarchy**: No model has more authority than others.
- **Simple Aggregation**: Works best when answers can be clearly categorized or binned.

### Use Cases

- Classification problems where models might have different specializations
- Factual questions with discrete possible answers
- Problems where model diversity helps avoid individual biases

### Implementation Considerations

- Requires a voting mechanism to count and determine the winning answer
- May need tie-breaking procedures for evenly split votes
- Can be extended with weighted voting based on model confidence or past performance

## 2. Debate Architecture

The Debate architecture facilitates structured discussion between multiple agent models, with a moderator model guiding the process and making the final determination.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'dark',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#2c3e50',
      'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#7f8c8d',
      'lineColor': '#ffffff',
      'secondaryColor': '#1abc9c',
      'tertiaryColor': '#2980b9'
    }
  }
}%%

        B_A2[Agent 2]:::modelNode
        B_AZ[Agent...]:::modelNode
        B_P1[Position 1]:::answerNode
        B_P2[Position 2]:::answerNode
        B_PZ[Position...]:::answerNode
        B_F[Final Position]:::answerNode
        
        B_Q --> B_M
        B_Q --> B_A1 & B_A2 & B_AZ
        B_A1 --> B_P1
        B_A2 --> B_P2
        B_AZ --> B_PZ
        B_P1 & B_P2 & B_PZ --> B_M
        B_M --> B_F
        
        B_note["Agents advocate for
their positions
Moderator mediates
and decides"]
    end
    
    Debate:::debateNodes
```

### Key Characteristics

- **Adversarial Process**: Models openly debate and challenge each other's reasoning.
- **Structured Dialogue**: The moderator guides discussion and ensures productive exchange.
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Requires models to explain their positions and counter others.
- **Mediated Decision**: The moderator evaluates arguments and determines the strongest position.

### Use Cases

- Complex reasoning tasks with multiple valid approaches
- Ethical or subjective questions where reasoning quality matters
- Scenarios requiring thorough exploration of multiple perspectives

### Implementation Considerations

- Requires defining debate protocols and structure
- May involve multiple rounds of exchange between agents
- Moderator model needs special capabilities to evaluate arguments

## 3. Judge & Jury Architecture

The Judge & Jury architecture separates the presentation of the case from its evaluation, with additional lookup tools to verify facts.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'dark',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#2c3e50',
      'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#7f8c8d',
      'lineColor': '#ffffff',
      'secondaryColor': '#1abc9c',
      'tertiaryColor': '#2980b9'
    }
  }
}%%

    subgraph Judge["JUDGE & JURY"]
        J_Q[Question]:::questionNode
        J_J[Judge]:::modelNode
        J_D1[Deliberator 1]:::modelNode
        J_D2[Deliberator 2]:::modelNode
        J_L[Lookup]:::modelNode
        J_F[Final Answer]:::answerNode
        
        J_Q --> J_J
        J_J --> J_D1 & J_D2
        J_D1 & J_D2 --> J_J
        J_J --> J_L
        J_L --> J_J
        J_J --> J_F
        
        J_note["Judge elaborates case
Jury fact-checks & votes
Lookup tools: Docs, Brain, API"]
    end
    
    Judge:::judgeNodes
```

### Key Characteristics

- **Separation of Duties**: Judge presents the case, jury deliberates and evaluates.
- **External Verification**: Incorporates lookup tools to verify facts and claims.
- **Structured Deliberation**: Jury models discuss and fact-check specific aspects.
- **Evidence-Based**: Emphasizes factual accuracy and verifiable information.

### Use Cases

- Fact-intensive questions requiring verification
- Legal or rule-based reasoning where evidence matters
- Tasks requiring both reasoning and factual accuracy

### Implementation Considerations

- Requires integration with external knowledge sources
- Needs clear protocols for deliberation and evaluation
- Judge must be capable of synthesizing jury feedback

## 4. Monarchy Architecture

The Monarchy architecture features a central "Prime Directive" model that consults with domain expert models before making decisions.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'dark',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#2c3e50',
      'primaryTextColor': '#ffffff',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#7f8c8d',
      'lineColor': '#ffffff',
      'secondaryColor': '#1abc9c',
      'tertiaryColor': '#2980b9'
    }
  }
}%%

        M_E1[Expert 1]:::expertNode
        M_E2[Expert 2]:::expertNode
        M_E3[Expert 3]:::expertNode
        M_E4[Expert 4]:::expertNode
        M_E5[Expert 5]:::expertNode
        M_F[Final Answer]:::answerNode
        
        M_Q --> M_PM
        M_PM <--> M_E1 & M_E2 & M_E3 & M_E4 & M_E5
        M_PM --> M_F
        
        M_note["One model to rule them all
Prime directive model
consults domain experts"]
    end
    
    Monarchy:::monarchyNodes
```

### Key Characteristics

- **Centralized Authority**: One primary model directs the process and makes decisions.
- **Specialized Consultation**: Domain expert models provide specialized knowledge.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Prime model queries experts and receives input.
- **Integrated Decision**: Prime model synthesizes expert input into final answer.

### Use Cases

- Tasks requiring broad knowledge integration
- Questions spanning multiple domains
- Scenarios needing a consistent voice or approach

### Implementation Considerations

- Prime model must be capable of knowing when to consult experts
- Requires defining expert domains and consultation protocols
- Balance between expert input and prime model authority

## Comparison and Selection Guide

| Architecture | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best For |
|--------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Democracy | Simple, fair, reduces individual biases | May select mediocre consensus answers | Classification, factual questions |
| Debate | Thorough exploration of alternatives, transparent reasoning | Complex to implement, computationally intensive | Reasoning tasks, ethical questions |
| Judge & Jury | Fact verification, structured evaluation | Requires external tools integration | Fact-intensive queries, legal reasoning |
| Monarchy | Consistent voice, efficient knowledge integration | Depends heavily on prime model quality | Cross-domain questions, consistent outputs |

## Implementation and Extensions

These architectures can be extended and combined in various ways:

- **Weighted Democracy**: Models with better historical performance get more voting power
- **Multi-stage Processing**: Use different architectures for different phases of problem-solving
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combine elements of multiple architectures (e.g., Debate with Lookup)
- **Dynamic Selection**: Choose architecture based on question type or complexity

## Conclusion

The choice of MoM architecture should be guided by the specific requirements of your application, the nature of the problems being solved, and the characteristics of the available models. Each architecture offers unique advantages and challenges, making them suitable for different use cases.

By thoughtfully designing how multiple models interact, we can create AI systems that leverage the strengths of different models while mitigating their individual weaknesses, resulting in more robust, accurate, and trustworthy outputs.
