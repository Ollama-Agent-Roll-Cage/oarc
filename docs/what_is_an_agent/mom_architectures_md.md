# Mixture of Models (MoM) Architectures

## Existing Architectures

### 1. Democracy
- Multiple models answer the same question independently
- Each model votes on the final answer
- Answer with the most votes wins
- Equal representation with majority rule decision-making

### 2. Debate
- Multiple agents advocate for different positions
- Moderator model facilitates discussion between agents
- Agents present and defend their positions with reasoning
- Moderator decides the final position based on debate quality

### 3. Judge & Jury
- Judge model elaborates the case and presents options
- Jury models fact-check and vote on presented information
- External lookup tools provide additional reference information
- Judge makes final determination with jury input

### 4. Monarchy
- One "Prime Directive" model leads the entire process
- Domain expert models serve as specialized consultants
- Prime model consults experts as needed for domain knowledge
- Central model makes final determination with expert input

## Theoretical Additional Architectures

### 5. Parliament
- Different models represent different "constituencies" or domains
- Models form coalitions to support positions or solutions
- Requires majority or supermajority agreement to proceed
- Includes procedural rules for resolving deadlocks and conflicts

### 6. Hierarchy
- Tiered system of models with increasing levels of specialization
- Lower-tier models handle specific sub-problems or data processing
- Mid-tier models integrate sub-problem solutions into cohesive parts
- Top-tier models synthesize final answers from integrated components

### 7. Market
- Models "bid" with confidence scores on potential solutions
- Higher confidence models receive more weight in final decision
- Performance history affects future weighting and influence
- Dynamic resource allocation based on past accuracy and reliability

### 8. Swarm Intelligence
- Many small models work in parallel on micro-aspects of the problem
- Each model contributes small components to the overall solution
- Emergent solutions arise from collective modeling activity
- No central coordinator, using stigmergic communication patterns

### 9. Apprenticeship
- Large "teacher" model guides smaller "apprentice" models
- Apprentices specialize in different domains or reasoning styles
- Teacher delegates subtasks based on apprentice capabilities
- Teacher integrates and refines apprentice outputs into final answer

### 10. Adversarial
- Models explicitly try to identify flaws in each other's reasoning
- "Red team" models challenge proposed solutions and assumptions
- "Defense" models must address challenges or modify solutions
- Final answer requires surviving adversarial scrutiny from all angles

### 11. Ensemble
- Different model architectures tackle the same problem independently
- Results aggregated through statistical methods and weighting
- Weighted average based on historical performance in similar domains
- Specialized ensembles configured for different problem categories

### 12. Evolutionary
- Multiple model versions compete to provide best answers
- Successful approaches persist and are refined in future iterations
- Poor performers are modified or discarded from the pool
- System evolves over time to improve accuracy and efficiency

### 13. Federation
- Autonomous model "states" with clearly defined responsibilities
- Central coordinating model with limited powers to resolve conflicts
- Local models handle domain-specific requests independently
- Global model integrates responses and maintains consistency

### 14. Network
- Decentralized web of interconnected models with specialized functions
- Information flows between models based on relevance and need
- No single model has complete authority over the entire process
- Consensus emerges through distributed processing and feedback

### 15. Expert Panel
- Models selected based on domain expertise for specific questions
- Panel composition changes dynamically based on question type
- Equal weight given to each domain expert in their field
- Synthesis model integrates expert insights into coherent response

### 16. Blockchain Consensus
- Models must reach consensus through proof-of-work or proof-of-stake
- Reward mechanism for accurate predictions and useful contributions
- Historical record of all model contributions maintained for verification
- Immutable record of reasoning chains and decision processes

### 17. Cooperative Learning
- Models share insights and intermediate results during processing
- Specialized models assist each other with difficult sub-tasks
- Knowledge transfer between models during reasoning process
- Collaborative refinement of answers through iterative improvement

### 18. Direct Democracy
- End users vote alongside models on potential solutions
- Human feedback incorporated directly in decision process
- Models explain reasoning to influence and inform human votes
- Final answer requires human-AI consensus or supermajority

### 19. Meritocracy
- Models earn "reputation" based on past performance and accuracy
- Higher reputation models receive more influence in decision-making
- Reputation is domain-specific and contextual to problem types
- System rewards accuracy and penalizes errors through reputation
